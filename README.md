# hclean

Python script to clean up unused header files in C++ applications

## todo

- stop requiring sys header paths -- missing headers are logged as warnings
- % complete logged after every batch
- if initial header compile fails -- mark as warning and ignore
- allow quoted includes
- better asyncio usage for files
- better logging
- option to remove lines instead of commenting
